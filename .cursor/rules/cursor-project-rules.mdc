## General Rules

* The design system we have created is called Playbook, which has many sub-brand libraries within it

## Coding Methods and Patterns

* Follow the coding methods and patterns used in `/src/components` directory with TypeScript component, CSS module, and Storybook story
  * Place files at `/src/components/[name of component]`
  * Use the same file naming convention and folder organization
  * If this component contains subcomponents/nested components, please check to see if they exist and leverage those before creating a custom element or new component

## Tokens

* Only add a token variable to a css file if you see the exact token name in the figma component, don't make them up yourself
